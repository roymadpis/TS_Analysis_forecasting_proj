# Advanced Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

In this project, I leveraged a comprehensive suite of data science and machine learning tools to analyze and forecast time series data.
My work involved:
•	**Data Manipulation and Cleaning:** Utilized dplyr and tidyr for efficient data wrangling, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.
•	Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using ggplot2 and ggpubr to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
•	Time Series Analysis: Employed timetk and zoo for generating and manipulating time series data, enabling a deeper understanding of temporal patterns.
•	Forecasting Models: Developed and validated forecasting models using the forecast package, applying techniques such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing to predict future values.
•	Interactive Data Exploration: Implemented interactive tables with DT to facilitate dynamic data exploration and presentation.
•	Integration and Reporting: Combined multiple plots and tables using cowplot to create comprehensive reports that effectively communicated findings.
